    <h2>What is a Dementia Friend?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A <strong>Dementia Friend</strong> is someone who wants to make a
        <strong>positive difference</strong> in the lives of people living with
        dementia through <strong>increased awareness and support.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Even small changes</strong> can help support people living with
        dementia to remain <strong>included, accepted</strong> and
        <strong>connected</strong> with their community.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The Dementia Friends Indiana movement seeks to
          <strong>advance education</strong> and <strong> awareness</strong> of
          dementia, <strong>reduce the stigma</strong> associated with the
          disease, and <strong>create community environments</strong> that are
          <strong>welcoming and conducive</strong> for those living with
          dementia.
