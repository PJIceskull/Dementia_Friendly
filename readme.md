## About Project

This project is to establish a website for the Dementia Friendly Indianapolis initiative. [Dementia Friendly Indianapolis]() (started
in 2023) is an initiative focused on creating an inclusive environment for those living with dementia and their care partners through
**C.A.R.E (community events, awareness, resources, and education)**.

We are a part of the Dementia Friendly Indiana Community network, among 13 other communities in Indiana. For more information about what the DFA network is, check out [www.dfamerica.org](www.dfamerica.org). The initiative is governed by a cross-sector action team with multiple organizations involved, led by **CICOAâ€™s Dementia Programs Team**.

DFIndy hosts various events such as memory cafes (a safe space for someone living with dementia and their care partner to gather and
connect with others), business trainings, and an annual Fall Festival.

The **goal** of this website is to:

- Have an SEO-friendly homepage.
- An About Us section where visitors can learn what the initiative is.
- An event schedule and registration for events.
- A Resources page for links and documents.
- A contact form that individuals can fill out to learn more.

### About CICOA

[CICOA](https://cicoa.org/) is the statewide administrator of Dementia Friends Indiana, a 60-minute education session designed
to inform people of how to interact and support someone living with dementia. DFIndy is a SEPARATE, COMMUNITY initiative that
involves various projects and education materials. We hope having an additional website for DFIndy will help reduce the confusion
between the two.

## Project Structure

This section of the readme will be going over the folder structure of our project.
For building the website, we used the following languages below:

- **HTML** - The base markup language that we'll be using to build the website.
- **CSS** - For mainly styling the website's visuals and it's overall responsivess to other devices. Most CSS work is done through SASS for organizational purposes and then compiled into one file.
- **JavaScript** - The programming language that we'll use to implement Backend features and behaviors to the website.

### Styles

#### Sass

### Pages

### Lib

### SRC / Backend

_Add any programming languages, libraries, or frameworks you used in the project under the **readme file**._
